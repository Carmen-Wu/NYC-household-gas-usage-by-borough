# NYC-household-gas-usage-by-borough

##Overview
My project is based on data that highlights the gas usage by households located in NYC. The main purpose of this is to identify whether or not there is a trend, in terms of the borough and average gas usage, and if there is, to display it in a meaningful way. The problem to solve is if there is a difference in gas usage depending on certain locations, such as between Manhattan vs other boroughs. The solution is to use various python methods to clean the data and perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends between gas usage, location, and population. This relates to NYC because it would be interesting to see if there are any trends in gas usage based on the borough. NYC boroughs are always compared/contrasted with each other and it would be interesting to see if there are any significant differences in gas usage.


My underlying hypothesis is that the borough with the most residential households and the largest population will be the borough with the highest natural gas usage.  I predict that the average gas usage of an average person will be the same regardless of the borough.  


##The datasets I used are: 

-https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/New-York-State-ZIP-Codes-County-FIPS-Cross-Referen/juva-r6g2/data                   
--This dataset includes the borough of zip codes in NYC. 


-https://data.cityofnewyork.us/w/uedp-fegm/25te-f2tw?cur=zh_ETNBDGVA&from=root                                                                         
--This dataset shows gas usage of households/industries during 2010

--This dataset shows the population of each borough. 


I used Python3 to perform all data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The libraries used are standard libraries such as pandas, pandasql, and matplotlib.pyplot. I used these libraries in order to clean/filter the datasets, perform exploratory data analysis, and create visualizations for the results of my analysis.
